# U3L3-Can-I-Be-President-

You have been tasked with designing a questionnaire designed to determine a user's eligibility for being President of the United States of America. 

There are 6 criteria that would render an individual ineligible for the office of the President. Over the course of the questionnaire, the candidate should be presented with questions and responses pertaining to these criteria. After each criterion, the user should be informed whether or not they are still eligible for the presidency.

Of course, failure to meet just one of these criteria would bar an individual from serving as President, so once a criterion fails to be met then the user can be informed of their ineligibility and the questionnaire can end.  

As we have not learned conditionals with strings, feel free to ask the user to input 1 for yes or 2 for no if the criterion is phrased as such. As well, some criteria will require nested conditionals.

Feel free to utilize either the text field or the workspace below to decompose this task.
